This crate provides an implementation of an in-game performance/debug UI overlay
for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org).

The goal of this crate is to make it as useful as possible for any Bevy project:

- Made with Bevy UI (not egui or any other 3rd-party UI solution)
- Easy to set up (see [`simple`](examples/simple.rs) example)
- Modular! You decide what info you want to display!
  - Choose any combination of predefined entries (see [`specific_entries`](examples/specific_entries.rs) example):
    - Framerate (FPS), Frame Time, Frame Count, ECS Entity Count, CPU Usage, RAM Usage,
      Wall Clock, Running Time, Fixed Time Step, Fixed Overstep,
      Cursor Position, Window Resolution, Window Scale Factor, Window Mode, Present Mode
  - Implement your own custom entries to display anything you like!
    - (see [`custom_minimal`](examples/custom_minimal.rs) and [`custom`](examples/custom.rs) examples)
- Customizable appearance/styling (see [`settings`](examples/settings.rs), [`fps_minimalist`](examples/fps_minimalist.rs) examples)
- Support for highlighting values using a custom font or color!
  - Allows you to quickly notice if something demands your attention.

Spawning a Perf UI can be as simple as:

```rust
commands.spawn(PerfUiCompleteBundle::default());
```

If you want to create a Perf UI with specific entries of your choice,
just spawn an entity with `PerfUiRoot` + your desired entries, instead
of using the bundle.

```rust
commands.spawn((
   PerfUiRoot::default(),
   PerfUiEntryFPS::default(),
   PerfUiEntryClock::default(),
   // ...
));
```

If you want to customize the appearance, set the various fields in each of the
structs, instead of using `default()`.
